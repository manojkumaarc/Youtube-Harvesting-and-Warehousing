# Youtube-Harvesting-and-Warehousing
This project is entirely scripted in python 3 using Visual code. Youtube channel details are extracted using Google API. MongoDB was used to collect and store the extracted data. Then the data is structured using MySQL. Ten different queries are framed to analyze the metrics of the required youtube channels.
